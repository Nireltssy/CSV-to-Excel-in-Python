# CSV-to-Excel-in-Python
Easy way to convert Excel file to CSV and CSV to Excel with GUI using python.


Do you need Python 3 on you machine.

This project was born out of a real need for a project, which required a CSV registration that generated incompatibility with the one created by the office package therefore, this project was created in python with an easy-to-view GUI.

The project is on PT-BR and will soon be on EN-US.

enjoy!!!
